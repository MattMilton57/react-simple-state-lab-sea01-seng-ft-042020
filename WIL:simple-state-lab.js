// it can be really frustrating to write default props but i was actually just missing a few steps. in the end I had to borrow Clarions because it was just taking too long. the end result looked like this:

export default Matrix

Matrix.defaultProps = {
  values: [
    ['#F00', '#F00', '#F00', '#F00', '#F00', '#F00', '#F00', '#F00', '#F00', '#F00'], 
  ]
}

//note that the statement is located BENEATH the export default statement. I spent most of my time trying to set a prop as the default prop and working a thousand ways to do that, it isnt possible. it makes sene as there can only be one default prop so it needs to be written out speciffically.

// dont forget that props can be sent to other components within a return statement nested inside a function like this:
genRow = (vals) =>{ 
    return vals.map(val => <div className="cell"><Cell value={'#fff'}/></div>) 
  }
//I know that a lot of time was spent while building classEngage trying to figure out a way to do this within the render method but you dont have to. the method that is sending this ccan be a callback function or called in componentDidMount

// This:
state={
    color:this.props.value
}
// holy shit, this is a thing. State can be set directly with a prop. Holy shit holy shit. Im knot sure why this amazes me so much but...yeah.

// Also this:
return(
    <div className="cell" style={{backgroundColor: this.state.color}} onClick={(e) => this.handleclick(e)} >
            hat
    </div>
)
// life lesson genious: dont spend 30 minutes trying to get a backgroundcolor style change directly into the onclick event and then another 20 minutes trying to get it into the handleclick function when you can just set the initial background color to state and change that instead. State is kind of a big deal, especially when changing anything, USE IT.
